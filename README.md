# pmh-tutorial

This code was downloaded from < https://github.com/compops/pmh-tutorial > and contains the code used to produce the results in the tutorial:

J. Dahlin and T. B. Sch√∂n, **Getting started with particle Metropolis-Hastings for inference in nonlinear models**. Pre-print, arXiv:1511:01707, 2017. 

The papers are available as a preprint from < http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.01707 >.

Included material
--------------
**r/** This is the main implementation. The complete R code developed and implemented in the tutorial. This code was used to make all the numerical illustrations in the tutorial including the figures and tables. The workspaces for these runs are also provided together with the code to reproduce all the figures. 

**python/** Code for Python to implement the basic algorithms covered in the tutorial. Implementations for the advanced topics are not provided. Only simple plotting is implemented and no figures or saved data from runs are provided.

**matlab/** Code for MATLAB to implement the basic algorithms covered in the tutorial. Implementations for the advanced topics are not provided. Only simple plotting is implemented and no figures or saved data from runs are provided.

**r-package/** The files for the R package pmhtutorial on CRAN. These are very similar to the files in *r/*, which is more useful to learn the algorithms covered in the tutorial. However, this R package is simple to download and use directly.

**matlab-skeleton** Skeleton code files for MATLAB to help step-by-step implementation during courses and seminars.
