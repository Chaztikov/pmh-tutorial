# pmh-tutorial

This code was downloaded from https://github.com/compops/pmh-tutorial and contains the code used to produce the results in the tutorial:

J. Dahlin and T. B. Sch√∂n, **Getting started with particle Metropolis-Hastings for inference in nonlinear models**. Pre-print, arXiv:1511:01707, 2017. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
The papers are available as a preprint from http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.01707. The R package connected to this tutorial is available directly via CRAN and the source code is available at https://github.com/compops/pmh-tutorial-rpkg/.
=======
The tutorial is available as a preprint from http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.01707. An R package is also provided on CRAN with the implementation of the turorial in R. The source code (almost identitical to the code in the subdirectory R/) is found at https://github.com/compops/pmh-tutorial-rpkg.

Included material
--------------
**r/** This is the main implementation. The complete R code developed and implemented in the tutorial. This code was used to make all the numerical illustrations in the tutorial including the figures and tables. The workspaces for these runs are also provided as a [zip-file in the latest release of the code](https://github.com/compops/pmh-tutorial/releases/latest) to reproduce all the figures in the tutorial. 

**python/** Code for Python to implement the basic algorithms covered in the tutorial. Implementations for the advanced topics are not provided. Only simple plotting is implemented and no figures or saved data from runs are provided.

**matlab/** Code for MATLAB to implement the basic algorithms covered in the tutorial. Implementations for the advanced topics are not provided. Only simple plotting is implemented and no figures or saved data from runs are provided.
