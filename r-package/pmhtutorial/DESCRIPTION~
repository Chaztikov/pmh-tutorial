Description: Routines for state estimate in a linear
    Gaussian state space model and a simple stochastic volatility model using
    particle filtering. Parameter inference is also carried out in these models
    using the particle Metropolis-Hastings algorithm that includes the particle
    filter to provided an unbiased estimator of the likelihood. The code is developed
    in the paper and all the details are explained there. This package is meant as a
    minimal working example of these algorithm and is only meant for educational use
    and as a start for learning to implement these algorithms on your own.
